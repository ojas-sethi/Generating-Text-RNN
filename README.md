# Generating-Text-RNN
This project uses an RNN to generate text based on Shakespear's training data. This training data can be modified to any piece of text. The model then tries to generate its own text in the style of the training data provided.
To avoid training the model every time you run the script, train the model once and then comment out the part between the ```# MODEL TRAINING STARTS``` and ```# MODEL TRAINING ENDS``` comments.

This project uses TensorFlow for the RNN model.
